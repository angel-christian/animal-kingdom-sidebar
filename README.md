## 🔍 About the Project

I built this project as part of my web development learning journey to explore layout structuring, hover effects, and CSS interactivity techniques.

What makes it interesting:
- ✅ **Checkbox Hack** to toggle the sidebar
- ✅ Hamburger and Close icons created using `label` tags
- ✅ Smooth transitions and hover effects
- ✅ Thematic design using a powerful background image (lion)
- ✅ Responsive and clean UI built with only two files: `index.html` and `style.css`

> 🧠 This project helped me realize that **JavaScript isn't always required** to build functional UI components!
